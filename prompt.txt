Here are some introductions from academic papers
paper1[The demand for efficient energy systems and high-performance electronic devices has created the challenging requirement to rapidly identify new materials and design nanostructures with extreme transport properties.As the limitations of traditional intuition-driven trial-and-error search methods become more prominent,machine learning (ML)and data informatics have emerged as powerful tools for solving these design and optimization problems.In thermal transport,ML methods have found success in predicting material properties and accelerating design of nanostructures with target thermal transport1-9. However,the applications of ML to solve thermal engineering problems till date have been limited to finding solutions that show optimization of a well understood effect,such as maximization of disorder-induced Anderson phonon localization.In contrast,ML has not been used to explore and discover exceptional solutions, which exhibit unexpected or unknown phonon transport physics. This can be attributed to the 'interpolative'nature of traditional ML algorithms which allows for accurate prediction and explora- tion within the subspace spanned by known data points (and, therefore,known physics),but fails for excursions outside the training dataset.Consequently,suitable adaptations are needed to use ML methods in the identification of materials or nanostruc- tures showing exceptional physical properties.
In this work,we demonstrate the potential of an adaptive machine learning approach to identify unexpected thermal transport behavior in aperiodic superlattices.Binary superlattices (SLs),composed of periodically alternating layers of two materials, have received widespread attention in the recent decades due to their lower lattice thermal conductivity (K))compared to the constituent materials10-13,which makes them greatly attractive for applications such as thermoelectric devices14-16.Recent studies have shown that randomizing the constituent layer thicknesses in periodic SLs further reduces K,even below the random alloy limit717-23.In the resulting aperiodic superlattices or random multilayers (RMLs),destructive interference of coherent phonons due e to reflections at the randomly spaced interfaces can cause Anderson localization,thereby limiting thermal transport by theselong iwavelength phonon modes18,24.Additionally,ML methodssuch as Bayesian optimization3 and genetic algorithms(GA)?haveallowed efficient identification of RML structures with ultra-lowthermal conductivities at a fraction of the computational costassociated with exhaustively searching the prohibitively large setof candidate structures.However,it has not yet been elucidatedwhether certain random distributions of SL layer thicknesses canactually lead to higher Ky than the periodic SLs.Interestingly,in arecent study,Wei et al.25 used a GA-based search process toidentify two-dimensional graphene nanomeshes with disorderedpore configurations showing enhanced Ky than nanomeshes withuniformly spaced pores.Their results challenged the previousunderstanding that randomness in pore spacings leads to lower Kin these systems2627,and motivate the search to find exceptionsfor other well understood systems such as 1-D SLs and RMLs.Suchrareexamples of multilayered phononic structures showingenhanced thermal transport can also benefit applications suchas thermal management of quantum cascade lasers28,29.However,the heuristic GA search method used in Wei et al.'s work25,although considered to be 'extrapolative'due to the ability toexplore the design space outside the initial known dataset,is stillcomputationally expensive for the identification of very low-probability-of-occurence solutions as a result of the probabilisticnature of the GA evolutionary operators of selection,crossover,and mutation.Therefore,we look to find a systematic approachthat can utilize theadvantages of ML whileenablinganextrapolative approach for the efficient identification of excep-tional solutions.Here,we identify RML structures with unexpectedly higher Kthan corresponding SLs with same total length and averageperiod.To accelerate the search over the prohibitively largedesign space,a convolutional neural network (CNN)-basedprediction method is used for obtaining the K of the candidatestructures.An iterative approach is employed for generating arepresentative training dataset that enables the CNN to accuratelypredict the high ky of the target RML structures that are absent from the initial dataset.Finally,the identified non-intuitive RMLstructures are used to gain insight into the heat transportmechanisms leading to higher Ky and its correlation with RMLstructural features.]

paper2[Inspired by the discoveries and synthesis of some new carbonand boron nitride materials at the nanoscale suchas one-dimensional (1D)carbon nanotubes (CNTs)[1].1D boron nitridenanotubes(BNNTs)[2],two-dimensional(2D)graphene [3]and 2Dhexagonal boron nitride (hBN)[4,5],vast scientific efforts arecurrently devoted to study the physical properties of these newcarbon and BN allotropes and,accordingly,investigate the potentialengineering applications of these new materials.For instance,anultrahigh Young's modulus of~1 TPa and an extremely large ther-mal conductivity of ~6600 W/mK are observed in CNTs [6-8],which are widely used in nano-sensors and composite materials[9,10].Similarly,graphene is reported to possess the extraordinarymechanical and thermal properties involving the Young's modulusof ~1 TPa,the tensile strength of 130 GPa [11]and a prominentthermal conductivity of ~4000 W/mK [12,13],which make gra-phene appealing in the applications of thermoelectric devices and nanocomposites [14-16].As the analogues of CNTs,BNNTsaresimilarly found to possess a large axial Young's modulus of~1.2 TPa[17]and a high thermal conductivity of ~400 W/mK [18].Mean-while,the BNNT uniquely is a wide band gap semiconductor withthe distinguishable chemical stability [19,20].which thus can betreated as an important semiconducting and encapsulating mate-rial at the nanoscale [21,22].The 2D hBN nanosheets have an ultra-wide band gap [23],a high thermal conductivity [24-26]and alarge Young's modulus [27,28].all of which are comparable to thoseof their 1D BNNT counterparts.Thus,hBN nanosheets are expectedto serve as the important matrices for high-performance nano-composites [29,30]and also the important building blocks for next-generation electronic devices [31].
Considering the fact that the low-dimensional carbon nano-materials and their BN counterparts have the similarity in theiratomic structures but have the difference in some material prop-erties,researchers also have made a great deal of efforts to explorethe synergy of the distinctive material properties by fabricating thehybrid C-BN nanomaterials.These C-BN nanomaterials are ex-pected to possess the physical properties different from their purecomponents and thus have the broader engineering applications.Recently,the hybrid graphene-hBN sheets have been successfullysynthesized in experiments [32-34].The physical performance ofthese heterostructures can be significantly modified by changingthe doping concentration of their carbon or BN components.Forexamples,the piezoelectric coefficient of hybrid graphene-hBNsheet can be significantly increased by increasing the concentra-tion of carbon component [35].Meanwhile,the Young's modulusand thermal conductivity of hybrid graphene-hBN sheets and C-BNnanotubes are found to increase as the doping concentration ofcarbon component increases [36-39].
Although the aforementioned carbon and BN nanomaterialssuch as CNTs,BNNTs,graphene,hBN nanosheets and their heter-ostructures possess many remarkable properties,the low-dimensional structures of these materials greatly restrict theirfurther engineering applications.Under this circumstance,fabri-cating new three-dimensional (3D)carbon and BN nanomaterialshaving properties almost comparable to their low-dimensionalcounterparts is receiving increasing attention from the materialcommunity.Recently,3D carbon honeycombs(CHCs)comprised ofgraphene components have been synthesized successfully in ex-periments [40].Many studies have revealed that CHCs possessnumerous prominent properties involving the low density,largesurface area per unit mass and high specific strength [40-45].which indicate that CHCs have great potential applications in gasand liquid storage and are suitable to serve as the compositematrices [40,46,47].Similarly,the BN honeycomb(BNHC)has beentheoretically confirmed as a new stable 3D BN nanomaterial[48-50],whose atomic configuration is analogous to that of its CHCcounterpart.Compared with CHCs,BNHCs are reported to possessthe unique piezopotential property [51,52].In addition,both themechanical and thermal transport properties of BNHCs are found togreatly lower than those of CHCs [52-54].Inspired by the suc-cessful fabrication of 2D hybrid C-BN nanomaterials in experimentsand the very different material properties observed between CHCsand BNHCs,it is expected to establish 3D hybrid C-BN honeycombs(C-BNHCs)comprised of both BNHC and CHC cells in the near future,which may have the wide tunable material properties be-tween those of pure BNHCs and CHCs.Thus,optimizing the BNHCor CHC concentration in C-BNHCs and designing the pattern of C-BNHC structures play the crucial roles in the future materialdesign of hybrid C-BNHCs.
In general,the conventional artificial design and automateddesign are two methods widely used to design the materials withrequired properties.It is noted that the artificial design often de-pends on heuristic hypothesis or intuitive methodologies derivedfrom numerous errors and trials,which thus impede its applicationin material structure design and optimization.In order to overcomethe limitation of artificial design methods,the emerging advancedcomputational algorithms such as machine learning (ML),topo-logical optimization and generative algorithms have been recentlyproposed for designing material structures automatically.Espe-cially,the ML-based methods have been widely utilized indesigning the molecular structures of complex nanomaterials tosatisfy some specific requirements.For examples,the ML methodhas been employed to design the kirigami-inspired graphene forsearching optimal structures with the largest ultimate strain[55,56].Meanwhile,the hole distribution in porous graphene hasbeen optimized via ML to obtain target structures with desiredthermal conductivity [57,58]and mechanical properties [59,60].
Motivated by aforementioned studies,it is of great interest to usethe ML method to design the structures of C-BNHCs to make thempossess some specific material properties such as the requiredthermal conductivity.In this paper,through combing the ML method and classicalmolecular dynamics(MD)simulations,we investigate the thermal transport property of C-BNHCs and also propose an inverse designmethod for designing the structure of C-BNHCs with the requiredthermal conductivity.Here,the impacts of the concentration andarrangement of doping BNHC cells on the thermal conductivity of C-BNHCs are analyzed carefully with the help of a convolutionalneural network(CNN),which is modified based on the VGGNet[61].With the aid of the CNN,a ML-based inverse structural opti-mization method is developed for searching optimal structurespossessing the required thermal conductivity among a large-scaledesign space.The obtained results indicate that the present ML-based method is able to find plenty optimal C-BNHC structurespossessing the target thermal conductivity efficiently,accuratelyand practically.]

paper3[ The successful isolation of atomically thin crystals of carbon in  2004, while pioneering the trend toward two-dimensional (2D)  materials, also brought the question ‘What would we do with  layered structures with just the right layers?"2 from Feynman's  prophetic public lecture notes in 1959 back into the limelight,  which was an early prototype of the layered 2D/2D van der  Waals (vdW) heterostructures. The so-called vdW hetero-  structures, which are also laminar structures formed by  physically assembling prefabricated 2D materials by means of  material-integration with low-energy vdW forces, will allow for a  more diverse spatial configuration of the structures. Such  unparalleled creative capabilities, combined with the out-  standing properties of 2D materials themselves, have allowed  them to show great potential in the fields of materials science,  condensed matter physics, and semiconductor devices.The ideal performance of graphene (Gr),a precursor of 2D materials,is greatly limited by the silicon dioxide substrate,,34 which is reflected in the great limitation on the mobility of Gr by the surface phonons of the substrate due to its inherent charged impurities and the surface phonons.Insofar,an atomically flat insulator free of dangling bonds and electrical traps,hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),has successfully attracted widespread academic attention as an ideal substrate candidate for graphene.-7Thanks to the naturally small lattice mismatch of about 1%between the two,Gr/h-BN vdW heterostructures with pristine and contamination-free interfaces have been success- fully prepared in the laboratory,s which makes it possible to explore the promising properties of heterostructures.As expected,studies10 have shown that Gr using h-BN as a substrate has potential applications in enhancing electron mobility,tuning the optical energy band structure,and other device properties. It is worth noting that in the development of these material devices representing advanced technology,another energy transport mechanism that is as important as electric conduction has never received the attention it deserves,that is,heat transfer. However,it is precisely in the vdW devices that the waste Joule heat generated by energy dissipation due to the inherent micro-nanosize of the structure further aggravates the suboptimal performance of the device caused by excessive local temperature. Therefore,efficient thermal management and thermal design, from understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of heat transfer to further modulation of the associated thermal properties,is a pivotal issue for exploiting the full performance of 2D vdW heterostructure devices.To this end,Chen et al designed an asymmetric Gr/h-BN vdW heterostructure and successfully achieved phonon manipulation,which provided the possibility for the design of practical thermal rectification devices.In addition,Momeni et al also achieved the aim of enhancing the in-plane thermal properties of Gr with the h-BN substrate and investigated the specific effect of the shape and geometry of the h-BN cover on it.Not to be neglected, interfacial thermal conductance (ITC),a crucial issue in Gr/h- BN vdW heterostructures,has also been intensively investigated both experimentally and computationally.3-17 By means of density functional theory (DFT)calculations based on the first principles,Mao et aland Yan et alobtained ITC results of around 188 and 32.5+50 MWm-2 K-,respectively,in which the former being almost about 4 times higher than the latter. Alternatively,molecular dynamics(MD)simulations,which are widely used in condensed matter physics calculations,have yielded a number of research results.With the transient MD simulation,Zhang et al.s obtained the ITC result of about 4.8 MWm-2 K-1 based on the principle of experimental pump- probe techniques.Recently,Ren et al obtained an ITC result of 428+564 MWm2 K at 300 K by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD)simulation,which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than the result in ref 15.However,in terms of experiments,by Raman spectroscopy-based photo- metry,Chen et al.measured the ITC across the Gr/h-BN interface to be only 7.41 +0.43 MWm-2 K-1,which is much smaller than the available theoretical and simulation results. These results indicate that there are still many unknowns and uncertainties regarding the ITC of Gr/h-BN vdW hetero- structures and the heat transfer mechanisms within them,which remain an interesting challenge.Due to the many uncontrollable factors of experiments and the significant size limitations of theoretical calculations,the MD simulation is an excellent method to explore the physical properties of condensed matter.However,all of the existing MD simulations were performed with the aid of the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) software package,s and it has now been shown that the per- atom stress-based heat flux expression in this package is not applicable to the multibody potential cases.This therefore adds further unknowns to the already inconclusive nature of the thermal transport properties across the Gr/h-BN vdW heterostructures.At the same time,there is a lack of systematic research on the key issues of multilayer Gr/h-BN vdW heterostructures covering the structural configuration and size effect,which is precisely the problem that needs to be solved urgently.Beyond this,the brilliance ofthe ITC has attracted a lot of attention,while the equally important thermal transport properties of heterostructures,the out-of-plane thermal trans- port properties of the whole structure,have been almost inadvertently ignored.To address the above questions,we investigate the phonon thermal transport across multilayer Gr/h-BN vdW hetero- structures through extensive MD simulations,which specifically includes the ITC across the Gr/h-BN interface and the overall out-of-plane thermal conductivity (TC)of the heterostructures. First,the effect of its own structural configuration on the results was studied by means of the NEMD method and the size effect involved was also explored in detail.In addition,the effect of three external factors,namely,cross-plane strain,temperature, and interfacial coupling strength,on the phonon thermal transport of vdw heterostructures were also explored. Importantly,the underlying physical mechanisms have also been successfully revealed through the joint analysis of the atomic morphology at the interface,the spectral decomposition, and the phonon density of states within the frequency domain.]

In this work,we systematically investigate the impact of rotation angle on thermal transport across the graphene/h-BN vdw heterostructure based on nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD)simulations.Our results show that the intrinsic ITC for graphene/h-BN heterostructure is 509 MW/ (m2K)at 500 K without rotation,and ITc decreases monotonically with the rotation angle up to 30.The physical mechanisms causing the dependence of ITC on the rotation angle are also discussed.Our study reveals that interlayer rotation is a promising method to tune the interlayer themmal transport across vdW heterostructures.]

paper5[Graphene has attracted enormous attention over the past decade due to its excellent physical properties [1].However,pris- tine graphene is gapless which limits its application towards graphene-based semiconducting devices.To overcome this draw- back,nano-scale holes have been generated in graphene to open a finite bandgap [2].These holes not only modulate the electronic properties,but also have a significant effect on the thermal trans- port of graphene.For example,a recent experiment has shown that the thermal conductivity of porous graphene (with controllable number of holes)is considerably lower than that of pristine gra- phene [3].Developing approaches to reducing the thermal con- ductivity is critical for various applications,in particular for high figure of merit thermoelectric materials and devices [4-8]. Theoretical results also show that the thermal conductivity of porous graphene is significantly lower than pristine graphene.These results show that besides the density of holes,the spatial distribution of the holes also plays an important role in reducing the thermal conductivity.Most works have considered either random or periodic distributions of holes.For instance,several works have examined how to reduce the thermal conductivity by introducing periodic holes [9,10],while Hu et al.found that the thermal conductivity of porous graphene is significantly reduced by randomly distributed holes [11].Thus,most works have focused on the effect of a specific hole distribution type on the thermal con- ductivity of graphene.However,determining the optimal hole distribution for maximizing or minimizing the thermal conduc- tivity remains an open question,in particular because the design space increases dramatically with increasing number of holes. The machine learning(ML)method is a promising tool to screen over a large design space,which has primarily been used to predict properties of new materials [12-18].However,recent works have begun to use ML to design functional materials and structures while accounting for a potentially large design space.For instance, ML was applied in designing efficient molecular organic light- emitting diodes [19],solid electrolyte in lithium battery [20]. composites with high toughness [21],and graphene kirigami with high yield strain [22].The ML approach has also been used in predicting the thermal conductivity for nanomaterials and com- posite materials [23,24].Based on the ML approach,specific structures have been designed to achieve optimal thermal con- ductivity for composite materials [25],polymers [26].or nano- structures [27].Recently,Yamawaki et el.applied the ML approach to search the optimal distribution of holes in the graphene nano- ribbons to obtain low thermal conductivity and high thermoelec- tricity [28],where the holes are one-dimensionally distributed and the effect of two-dimensional distribution of holes in the graphene on the thermal conductivity is still unknown. In this paper,we study the effect of the density and two- dimensional distribution of holes on the thermal conductivity of porous graphene by combining molecular dynamics (MD)simula- tions,ML,and lattice dynamics calculations.We set up a convolu- tional neural network (CNN)model to learn and predict the thermal conductivity of porous graphene,and then perform inverse design to screen millions of candidates to determine the optimal design of porous graphene that exhibits the lowest thermal con- ductivity,which is a desirable property for thermoelectric materials and devices.The inverse design method based on the ML scheme is able to explore the relationship between the distribution of the holes and the thermal conductivity for the porous graphene,which requires only 103 simulations out of the full design space of 106 The methodology reveals that holes that are randomly distributed transverse to the direction of heat flow,but that exhibit some periodicity along the direction of heat flow,represent the optimal distribution to minimizing the thermal conductivity for porous graphene.Lattice dynamics calculations and wave packet simula- tions reveal that this spatial distribution effectively localizes the phonon modes in porous graphene,thus reducing the thermal conductivity.]

replan:
The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has ushered in a new era of materials science, where the discovery and synthesis of new materials at the nanoscale have become a focal point of scientific research. Among these, carbon and boron nitride materials have emerged as particularly promising due to their unique physical properties and potential for a wide range of engineering applications. Graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a structurally similar material composed of boron and nitrogen atoms, have received widespread attention. These materials exhibit remarkable properties, such as high thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, and stability, making them ideal candidates for efficient energy systems and high-performance electronic devices.

However, despite their exceptional properties, the application of these low-dimensional materials is not without challenges. One of the primary limitations lies in their inherent structural constraints. The two-dimensional nature of these materials, while contributing to their unique properties, greatly restricts their further engineering applications. This presents a significant challenge in the field, necessitating the development of innovative approaches to material design and optimization.

Moreover, the presence of point defects in these materials, including single, double, and triple points, can significantly affect their thermal conductivity. These defects, which can occur naturally or be introduced during the fabrication process, disrupt the perfect atomic arrangement of the materials, leading to variations in their properties. Understanding the effects of these defects on the interface thermal conductivity of graphene/hBN is of paramount importance, as it directly impacts the efficiency and performance of devices utilizing these materials.

In light of these challenges, the primary objective of this work is to investigate the effects of point defects concentration and defect distribution location on the interface thermal conductivity of graphene/hBN. To achieve this, we employ non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD), a powerful tool for studying thermal transport properties at the atomic level. NEMD allows us to simulate the behavior of these materials under various conditions, providing valuable insights into the complex interplay between defect type, concentration, and distribution.

In addition to NEMD, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of machine learning algorithm that has shown great success in predicting material properties and accelerating the design of nanostructures. By combining NEMD and CNN, we aim to predict the distribution of graphene point defects with the highest interface thermal conductivity. This involves exploring a vast design space, which is a challenging task due to the complex interplay between defect type, concentration, and distribution. However, by leveraging the power of these advanced computational methods, we aim to efficiently and accurately identify the optimal defect structures.

Furthermore, we seek to explain the impact of defect type distribution coupling on interface thermal conductivity. To this end, we will use the thermal conductivity spectrum (SHC) and phonon participation rate (ppr), two powerful tools for analyzing heat transport mechanisms at the atomic level. By understanding how different defect distributions affect thermal conductivity, we can gain valuable insights into the underlying physics and guide the design of graphene/hBN structures with enhanced thermal properties.

The scope of this work extends beyond the investigation of point defects in graphene/hBN. We also aim to design defect structures with the highest interface thermal conductivity. This involves not only identifying the optimal defect structures but also understanding the mechanisms that lead to enhanced thermal conductivity. By doing so, we hope to provide a systematic approach to the design and optimization of graphene/hBN structures, overcoming the limitations of traditional design methods and paving the way for the development of next-generation energy systems and electronic devices.

In conclusion, this work represents a significant step forward in the field of nanoscale materials science. By combining advanced computational methods with a deep understanding of thermal transportphysics, we aim to shed light on the complex effects of point defects on the interface thermal conductivity of graphene/hBN. This research not only contributes to our fundamental understanding of these materials but also has significant implications for their practical applications. By identifying the optimal defect structures and understanding the mechanisms that lead to enhanced thermal conductivity, we can guide the design of more efficient energy systems and high-performance electronic devices, ultimately contributing to the advancement of nanotechnology and materials science.

The potential impact of this work is vast. By improving our understanding of the effects of point defects on the thermal conductivity of graphene/hBN, we can enhance the performance of a wide range of devices that rely on these materials. Furthermore, the methodologies developed in this work, particularly the combination of NEMD and CNN, provide a powerful tool for the design and optimization of nanoscale materials. This not only opens up new possibilities for the design of graphene/hBN structures with enhanced thermal properties but also provides a blueprint for the study of other nanoscale materials.

In the broader context, this work contributes to the ongoing efforts to overcome the limitations of low-dimensional materials and unlock their full potential. The challenges associated with the structural constraints of these materials are not unique to graphene/hBN but are common to many other nanoscale materials. Therefore, the insights gained from this work have the potential to inform the study of other materials and guide the development of new strategies for material design and optimization.

In summary, this work represents a significant contribution to the field of nanoscale materials science. Through a detailed investigation of the effects of point defects on the interface thermal conductivity of graphene/hBN and the development of a systematic approach to material design and optimization, we aim to push the boundaries of what is possible with these remarkable materials. We believe that the findings of this work will not only advance our understanding of graphene/hBN but also pave the way for the development of more efficient and high-performance nanoscale devices.
